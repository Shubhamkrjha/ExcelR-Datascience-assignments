    "2.\tPC Magazine asked all of its readers to participate in a survey of their satisfaction with different brands of electronics. In the 2004 survey, which was included in an issue of the magazine that year, more than 9000 readers rated the products on a scale from 1 to 10. The magazine reported that the average rating assigned by 225 readers to a Kodak compact digital camera was 7.5. For this product, identify the following:\n",
